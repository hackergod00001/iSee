# iSee App - Deployment Guide for macOS

## Overview
iSee is a privacy-first shoulder surfer detection app for macOS that uses on-device face detection to alert users when someone else is looking at their screen.

## System Requirements
- **macOS**: 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) or Intel x64
- **Camera**: Built-in or external camera
- **Xcode**: 15.0 or later (for building from source)

## Quick Start (Pre-built App)

### Option 1: Download Pre-built App
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/hackergod00001/iSee/releases) page
2. Download `iSee-v0.0.1.dmg` for the latest version
3. Open the downloaded DMG file
4. Drag iSee.app to your Applications folder
5. Launch iSee from Applications or Spotlight
6. Grant camera permission when prompted

### Option 2: Build from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- macOS 13.0 or later
- Git (for cloning the repository)

#### Build Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hackergod00001/iSee.git
   cd iSee
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open isee.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Select your Mac as the target device
   - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run
   - Or use Product â†’ Run from the menu

4. **Alternative: Command Line Build:**
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -project isee.xcodeproj -scheme isee -destination 'platform=macOS' build
   ```

## Usage Instructions

### First Launch
1. **Camera Permission**: The app will request camera access. Click "Allow" to enable face detection.
2. **Positioning**: Position yourself in front of the camera so your face is clearly visible.
3. **Status Indicators**: Watch the status indicators at the bottom of the screen:
   - ðŸŸ¢ **Safe**: 1 face detected (normal state)
   - ðŸŸ  **Warning**: 2+ faces detected, counting down to alert
   - ðŸ”´ **Alert**: 2+ faces detected for sustained period
   - âš« **Error**: Camera issues or no faces detected

### Testing the App
1. **Single Face Test**: Ensure only your face is visible - should show "Safe" status
2. **Multi-Face Test**: Have someone else look at your screen - should trigger warning then alert
3. **Settings**: Click the gear icon to access settings (currently shows placeholder)

### Privacy & Security
- **100% On-Device Processing**: All face detection happens locally
- **No Data Storage**: No images or face data are stored or transmitted
- **No Network Access**: The app operates entirely offline
- **Camera Access Only**: The app only accesses the camera, no other permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working
- **Check Permissions**: Go to System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy â†’ Camera
- **Restart App**: Quit and relaunch iSee
- **Check Camera**: Ensure no other apps are using the camera

#### Face Detection Not Working
- **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting conditions
- **Position**: Make sure your face is clearly visible to the camera
- **Distance**: Stay within 1-3 feet of the camera for best results

#### App Won't Launch
- **macOS Version**: Ensure you're running macOS 13.0 or later
- **Architecture**: Check if you're using a supported Mac (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- **Permissions**: Check System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy â†’ General

### Performance Tips
- **Close Other Apps**: Free up system resources for better performance
- **Good Lighting**: Face detection works best in well-lit environments
- **Stable Position**: Avoid moving around too much while using the app
